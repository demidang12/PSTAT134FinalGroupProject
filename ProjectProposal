Project Idea: Portfolio Optimization 

Project Outline: 
Research the basics of stocks, trading, and economics
Obtain a subset of ten stocks and gather stock data related to selected stocks
Load, wrangle, and clean data 
Perform exploratory data analysis. I.E  check for missing data, relationships, dimension reduction,etc
Create a model and optimize model such that it will minimize the variance in the portfolio
Use seaborn or matplot to create visualizations that convey our findings
If time permits, expand the projects to include more stocks from possibly more industries
Develop poster presentation

Goal: Knowing the distribution of several stocks (A, B, Câ€¦), construct a portfolio that the return gives less uncertainty.
