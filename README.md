# Portfolio Optimzation  #
The project aims to select proportions of various stocks in order to minimize the volatility of the portfolio. Our project will not assume ideal conditions. We will take into account the assocaited costs with trading as well as the non-stationary nature of the financial market. If done correctly, our project will maximize returns while minimzing risk.
