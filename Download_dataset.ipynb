    "# Obtain Dataset from Yahoo Finance\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be getting our dataset from yahoo finance website. The module yfinance allows us to extract the stock data by python code into our notebooks. The module pandas_datareader allows the extracted data to be read in as a dataframe. The module yfinance only works with pandas version 0.24.2 and newer. Therefore, before we run this notebook it is necessary to upgrade pandas to the newest version. The packages are not included with the base modules in our jupyter notebook. The following cell will install the packages mentioned. "
