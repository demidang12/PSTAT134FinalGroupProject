    "**All of the datasets used for this website was downloaded from https://finance.yahoo.com/. The module yfinance allows us to extract the stock data by python code into our notebooks. The module pandas_datareader allows the extracted data to be read in as a dataframe. The module yfinance only works with pandas version 0.24.2 and newer. Before we run this notebook, we need to upgrade pandas to the newest version. The modeules yfinance and pandas_datareader are not part of the base modules installed in the server. Therefore, everytime the server restarts, we will need to redownload the modules. The following cell uses cell magic in order to run the necessary terminal commands to install the needed modules.** "

    "**The zipline algorithm iterates in intervals of daily and minutes. We decided to work with daily data since we are not interested in day trade. We are interested in trading every couple of days. Furthermore, choosing to work with daily data simplifies that project since daily stock data is highly volatile. We will be choosing to only be working with the US stock market. The reason for choosing this stock exchange is simply because we are studying in a US univeristy. The New York stock exchange was first created in the year 1817. We will not be using all the data available from the stock echange. We are interested in creating a portfolio that uses current data. An impactful economic event in modern day US history was the recession in 2008. This recession collapsed the market. To simplfy the project, we have chosen to select a year after 2008 as our starting year for downloading stock data. The stocks chosen are selected two from each sector. The sectors that we used are found from the Charles Schwab brokerage app. The sectors that were used are Information Technology, Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, Health Care, Consumer Staples, Industrials, Materials, Energy, Real Estate, Financials, and Utilities. The selections of stocks from each sector was done at random. We selected the two stocks from each sector at random. In another notebook, we will subset the stocks to ten for easier manipulation in zipline. The selection of the final 10 stocks will be based off a correlation matrix. SPY is the benchmark for our portfolio which we will used to compare how well different models work. SPY is the S&P500 which is a stock index of the 500 biggest publically traded companies. We hope to outperform SPY. If time permits, we will select stocks that are uncorrelated since that will allow for a well balanced portfolio. Finally, the end date for the downloaded stock data is 2018. The year 2018 is the most current and complete year in stock data.**"
