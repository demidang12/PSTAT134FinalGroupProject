    "**All of the datasets used for this website was downloaded from https://finance.yahoo.com/. The module yfinance allows us to extract the stock data by python code into our notebooks. The module pandas_datareader allows the extracted data to be read in as a dataframe. The module yfinance only works with pandas version 0.24.2 and newer. Before we run this notebook, we need to upgrade pandas to the newest version. The modeules yfinance and pandas_datareader are not part of the base modules installed in the server. Therefore, everytime the server restarts, we will need to redownload the modules. The following cell uses cell magic in order to run the necessary terminal commands to install the needed modules.** "

We are interested in trading every couple of days. Furthermore, choosing to work with daily data simplifies that project since daily stock data is highly volatile. We will be choosing to only be working with the US stock market. The reason for choosing this stock exchange is simply because we are studying in a US univeristy. The New York stock exchange was first created in the year 1817. We will not be using all the data available from the stock echange. We are interested in creating a portfolio that uses current data. An impactful economic event in modern day US history was the recession in 2008. This recession collapsed the market. To simplfy the project, we have chosen to select a year after 2008 as our starting year for downloading stock data. The stocks chosen are a subset of a well established mutual fund. SPY is the benchmark for our portfolio which we will used to compare how well different models work. SPY is the S&P500 which is a stock index of the 500 biggest publically traded companies. We hope to outperform SPY. If time permits, we will select stocks that are uncorrelated since that will allow for a well balanced portfolio. Finally, the end date for the downloaded stock data is 2018. The year 2018 is the most current and complete year in stock data.**"
